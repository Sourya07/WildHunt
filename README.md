# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```





Select Add a network manually.

Enter your Hardhat Network RPC URL, http://127.0.0.1:8545/ (or http://localhost:8545).

Enter your Hardhat Network chain ID, 1337 (or 0x539 in hexadecimal format).
